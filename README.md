# Contributing to Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity to get involved in the open source community and contribute to some amazing projects. This year, we're focusing on contributions related to HTML and CSS.

Here are some ways you can contribute:

- Improve the documentation for a project.
- Add new features to an existing project.
- Fix bugs in an existing project.

If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the issues section of a project you're interested in. Many projects will label issues with "hacktoberfest" to indicate that they would be a good choice for Hacktoberfest contributions.

Happy hacking!
